                            The bustling, compact island of Gamla Stan is the city’s old town, with cobbled streets and colorful 17th- and 18th-century buildings. It’s home to the medieval Storkyrkan cathedral and the Royal Palace, the king’s official residence. Stylish bistros serve New Nordic cuisine, while night spots include old-school pubs and chic cocktail bars. Stortorget is the main square and all the big attractions lead off it, including the baroque style Royal Palace (Kungliga Slottet) and The Royal Chapel (Storkyrkan) around the corner, where Crown Princess Victoria married Daniel Westling in June 2010.

                            The Royal Palace of Stockholm stands proudly on Slottsbacken in the Swedish capital’s charming Old Town. Designed by master architect Nicodemus Tessin the Younger – this enormous jewel of a regal building was inaugurated in 1754, providing a home for King Adolf Fredrik and Queen Louisa Ulrika. It was also built to house the central Swedish state administration and the Royal Library, hence its mighty size. Stockholm Palace is said to be one of the oldest castles still serving as an official royal residence. With over 600 rooms spread across eleven floors, it provides plenty of space today for King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden. The King and Queen also use the palace as a workplace and a highly impressive venue for receptions, such as state visits.

                            Storkyrkan (Great Church, Stockholm Cathedral), officially Church of St. Nicholas, is the oldest church in Gamla Stan, the old town in central Stockholm. It was first mentioned in 1279 and according to tradition was originally built by Birger Jarl, the founder of the city itself. For nearly four hundred years it was the only parish church in the city, the other churches of comparible antiquity originally built to serve the spiritual needs religious communities (e. g., Riddarholm Church). It became a Lutheran Protestant church in 1527. Inside the church the most famous artefact is the dramatic wooden statue of Saint George and the Dragon attributed to Bernt Notke (1489). The statue, commissioned to commemorate the Battle of Brunkeberg (1471), also serves as a reliquary, containing relics supposedly of Saint George and two other saints.
