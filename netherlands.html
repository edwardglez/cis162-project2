                            Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam is devoted to the life and work of Vincent van Gogh.The Van Gogh Museum was opened in 1973 and consists of two buildings. Dutch architect Gerrit Rietveld, a member of the progressive art movement De Stijl, designed the main structure. In 1999 the museum opened the new Exhibition Wing, designed by the Japanese architect Kurokawa Kisho. Both buildings have an open design that emphasizes geometrical forms and allows much natural light into the exhibition space.The core of the Van Gogh Museum’s collection was that of Theo van Gogh, Vincent’s younger brother. It remained in the van Gogh family until 1962, when, with the help of the government of the Netherlands, Vincent Willem van Gogh, the artist’s nephew, donated the collection to the Vincent van Gogh Foundation. The foundation then gave the collection to the Van Gogh Museum on permanent loan. The museum augmented it with works acquired through purchase and donation.

                            For two years during the Second World War, the Secret Annex served as a hiding place for Anne Frank and the other people there. After the war, it fell into disrepair. The Anne Frank House was established in 1957 and its main purpose was to preserve the hiding place. A committee of prominent citizens of Amsterdam took the initiative to save the building where Anne had written her diary from demolition. The Anne Frank House organisation was established in 1957 and its main purpose was to preserve the hiding place and open it up to the public, and to promote the ideals of Anne Frank in the process. The hiding place at Prinsengracht 263 was restored and it opened to the public on 3 May 1960. The Secret Annex was left empty at the request of Otto Frank. After the opening, the number of visitors to the House increased continuously, from several tens of thousands in the first years, to 1.2 million visitors a year today.

                            The first canals were dug for water management and defence. As the city expanded in the Middle Ages, successive defence moats ended up inside the walls and lost their function. But they acquired an important new one: local transport of merchandise. The warehouses along the old moats could store enormous quantities of trading goods that could be`pipelined through those moat-canals to a harbour full of ships that sailed all over the world that was known in those days. Almost half of the original water in Amsterdam was lost to landfills, but a full 25 percent of the city's surface still consists of navigable waterways. With 65 miles of ancient canals, Amsterdam is still the most watery city in the world. In the summertime, the canals can still be dense with sailing traffic. Strictly pleasure-cruising, privately and commercially.
