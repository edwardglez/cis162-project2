        <div class="content-small"><p>Travel,
            because if you don't travel then
            your thoughts won’t be strengthened,
            won’t get filled with ideas.
            Your dreams will be born with fragile legs and then you end up believing in tv-shows, and in those who invent enemies
            that fit perfectly with your nightmares
            to make you live in terror.<br /><br />
            
            Travel,
            because travel teaches
            to say good morning to everyone
            regardless of which sun we come from.<br /><br />
            
            Travel,
            because travel teaches
            to say goodnight to everyone
            regardless of the darkness
            that we carry inside.<br /><br />
            
            Travel,
            because traveling teaches to resist,
            not to depend,
            to accept others, not just for who they are
            but also for what they can never be.
            To know what we are capable of,
            to feel part of a family
            beyond borders,
            beyond traditions and culture.<br /><br />
            
            Traveling teaches us to be beyond.<br /><br />
            
            Travel,
            otherwise you end up believing
            that you are made only for a panorama
            and instead inside you
            there are wonderful landscapes
            still to visit. - Gio Evan</p></div>
